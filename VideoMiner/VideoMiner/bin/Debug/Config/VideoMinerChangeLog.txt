Changes to VideoMiner code

1. Vlc.DotNet Player control

  A. Added the Vlc.DotNet player control, downloaded from http://vlcdotnet.codeplex.com/
     This was a major rewrite, as the control has completely different methods and behaviours
     than the Windows Media Player control. The player itself is also a work in progress, so
     some workarounds had to be made to make sure the video time is always available.

  B. Encapsulated all video player code into the frmVideoPlayer class to remove many sources of bugs.

  C. Added some new features, like frame stepping forward (Vlc.DotNet does not support reverse frame-stepping), and
     the ability to toggle Play/Pause by clicking on the video, and make both the main VideoMiner form and the player
     form accept Space bar (toggle Play/Pause) and Right Arrow keypress (forward frame stepping).

  D. Added and linked the number of decimal digits for ounding of video times. This means that all video
     timestamp data are guaranteed to have the same number of digits, regardless of the video source.

2. Major revision of the way forms are processed. The way it was, all forms were global which
   means there was no longer encapsulation in classes. The code was very easy to break and
   really just not logical in any OO sense. This included:

  A. Removal of the 'myformslibrary' class which was a placeholder for a collection of form classes.
     There were over 6000 instances of this in the code!

  B. Re-integration of OOD by moving form instantiation around and making new events to be raised
     by classes, to preserve encapsulation.

3. Complete rewrite of the GPS connection form code, which involves a serial port object. This was
   a lot of work, as there are many situations which can arise such as the user unplugging
   the serial port, turning off the device, switching settings on the device, and data suddenly
   being corrupted. This means many different exceptions are thrown, all of which have to be handled
   or the application will crash or freeze. Other additions:

  A. A threaded timer which does a realtime check of the data using data arrival timestamps
     to ensure the current data are the most recent. The 'timeout' is continuously subtracted
     from the previous timestamp to ensure data correctness.

  B. Proper raising of events GPSVariablesChanged, GPSConnected and GPSDisconnected so that this
     class does not rely on any others. This could be added to any project at this point and
     used again.

  C. A user-launchable window to show the current data if the port is connected. There is also a
     Pause button so that values can be cut from the NMEA strings if necessary.

  D. User can now change timeout manually in the form.
